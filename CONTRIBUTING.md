# Welcome to the Harvey contribution guidelines

Thank you for investing your time into Harvey!

### Development Guidelines

- Make sure that you branch from the `dev` branch. All new work is merged to the
  `dev` branch.

### Pull Requests

Once you are ready to merge your changes into our repository you can create a
pull request.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Please request for a code review from a project maintainer to expedite your
  merge.
- Make sure you are fully satisfied with the work you are pushing
- If you are introducing a new dependancy please ensure that it is well
  maintained and activly worked on. We may reject pull requests that rely on
  smaller, less widely known, deps.
